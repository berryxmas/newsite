# Overview:
V.I.C.T.O.R.Y. is an AI-powered application designed to identify non-inclusive language in job vacancies, particularly targeting age, gender, and background biases. This project aims to address youth unemployment by ensuring that job postings are inclusive and accessible.

# Key Features:
- Discrimination Detection: Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify potentially discriminatory language in job vacancy texts.
- Machine Learning: Trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes model for binary classification of vacancies as inclusive or non-inclusive.
- Real-time Feedback: Highlights non-inclusive words in real-time and provides suggestions for improving vacancy text.

# Technologies:
- Streamlit: Built a user-friendly web interface for job vacancy analysis and feedback visualization.
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Applied for text preprocessing and pattern matching of discriminatory language.
- GPT-3: Integrated for generating inclusive word suggestions to enhance job postings.
