# Overview:
This project involved implementing APISIX, a high-performance API gateway, to enhance API management for our advanced analytics team. The goal was to gain control over our API usage, which was previously consumed by other teams without proper oversight, and enable easy routing to our PostgreSQL database.

# Key Features:
- API Usage Visibility: Before APISIX, our team lacked a clear overview of how our APIs were being consumed. With APISIX, we can now monitor and manage API traffic more effectively.
- Database Integration: We were unable to create routes to our PostgreSQL database, limiting our flexibility. With APISIX, routing to databases and other services is seamless.
- Effortless API Management: APISIX has simplified API management, making it not only more functional but also enjoyable to work with.

# Business Value:
- Improved Team Collaboration: Our analytics team now has complete oversight of how our APIs are used by other teams, ensuring better resource allocation.
- Streamlined API Workflow: Easier management of API routes has led to more efficient workflows and faster response times for database queries.
- Scalability and Flexibility: APISIX provides a scalable solution that allows for easy adaptation as our API needs evolve.
